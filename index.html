            </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>We are the Students' Gymkhana body that oversees student-alumni Relations, publicizing achievements of
                IIT Kanpur, and outreach programs in collaboration with the Dean of Resources and Alumni (DoRA), IIT
                Kanpur.</p>
            <p>We organize talks and networking programs for mentorship and career guidance for the students.</p>
            <p>We promote and encourage the strengthening and development of our student-alumni relations by organising
                a plethora of events, like Tips from the Top series, the Alumni Buddy program, Mock-en-Joy, Legacy Hunt.
                We also help in the organisation of Alumni Reunions, Chapter Meetups, and Convocation in collaboration
                with IITKAA and DORA.
                Apart from tirelessly working to create a harmonious student-alumni community, we raise funds for
                various movements like 'Fundraising for IITK Workers' and '#OneAlumnusOneStudent Fundraising Camp.'</p>

                <p>Internships are vital to one's career. They're a chance to explore opportunities and determine a
                    potential professional path.</p>
                <p>But acquiring an internship is time-consuming. Interviews follow many examinations and group
                    discussions. These interviews need you to show your best self and answer confidently. To do well, be
                    on the same page as the interviewer and answer accordingly.</p>
                <p>The ideal method to prepare is to mock in a similar situation as the D-day, with frequent feedback
                    and criticism from specialists. Outreach Cell brings you the opportunity to face an IITK Alumnus for
                    a Mock Interview through its flagship event, "Mock-en-Joy." We have collaborated with IITK Alumni
                    who have ample experience in the profile you wish to work in, and they will interview you from the
                    same industry/field that you will be opting for on D-Day.</p>

                <h2 class="h-tertiary center">Alumni Buddy Program</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The Outreach Cell has developed yet another possibility that will make your college experience more
                    tranquil and fruitful. We are starting the fourth edition of our signature event for sophomore
                    students, the Alumni Buddy Program, where you will have a terrific opportunity to meet with an
                    alumnus in person.</p>
                <p>We recognise that picking between research, continuing with core, exploring finance, and attempting
                    software careers can be very confusing. And here, alumni with years of expertise in their respective
                    industries come to your aid, clearing your doubts and guiding your career.</p>
                <p>An Alumni Buddy is similar to a godmother or godfather allocated to you who may provide guidance on a
                    variety of issues and assist you in pursuing your ideal job.</p>
